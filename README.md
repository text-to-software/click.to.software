[Retool - Build internal tools, remarkably fast.](https://retool.com/)

example:

[Title your first app - Retool](https://softreck.retool.com/apps/ae2284e6-dc5c-11ed-8bba-e3196c60dd4f/Title%20your%20first%20app)

### Built for developers

Retool is highly hackable, so you’re never limited by what's available out of the box. If you can write it with JavaScript and an API, you can build it in Retool.

**You can write JavaScript almost anywhere inside of Retool.** Just wrap an expression with double brackets like `{{ Math.max(select1.value, 10) }}` and it’ll execute as sandboxed JS. Using Transformers, you can write larger, reusable blocks of code for manipulating data. There’s also a native API for directly interacting with components and queries via JS.

## Why it's not the best solution to use no-code/low-code in every software development process?


### Limited Flexibility:

No-code platforms offer limited flexibility, so complex applications may not be able to be built using this technology.  


### Security Risk: 

Since no-code platforms are easy to use, they may be more prone to security risks due to lack of coding knowledge.  


### Cost: 

While no-code/low-code platforms may be cheaper in the short-term, in the long-term, the cost of maintenance and upgrades can be quite high.  


### Scalability: 

No-code platforms may not be able to handle large-scale applications due to their limited capabilities.  


### Maintenance: 

No-code platforms may require more frequent updates and maintenance, which can be time-consuming and costly.
