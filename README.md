## Why it's not the best solution to use no-code/low-code in every software development process?


### Limited Flexibility:

No-code platforms offer limited flexibility, so complex applications may not be able to be built using this technology.  


### Security Risk: 

Since no-code platforms are easy to use, they may be more prone to security risks due to lack of coding knowledge.  


### Cost: 

While no-code/low-code platforms may be cheaper in the short-term, in the long-term, the cost of maintenance and upgrades can be quite high.  


### Scalability: 

No-code platforms may not be able to handle large-scale applications due to their limited capabilities.  


### Maintenance: 

No-code platforms may require more frequent updates and maintenance, which can be time-consuming and costly.
